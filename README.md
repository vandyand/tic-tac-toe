# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple, browser-based tic-tac-toe game. It allows users to play against the computer or another human.

## Rules
The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to Play
Open `index.html` in your browser and start playing!

## Code Structure
The game logic is handled by the `Game` class, the player logic is handled by the `Player` class, and the board logic is handled by the `Board` class. If a single player mode is implemented, the `AI` class will handle the computer's moves.

## Run Locally
